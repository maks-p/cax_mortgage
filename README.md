# Entry in Data Science Competition

This project was completed as part of Module 3 for the Flatiron School Data Science Immersive, March 11 2019 Cohort.

# Project Objective

From the contest organizer:

Propensity to fund mortgages describes the natural tendency for a mortgage to be funded based on certain factors in a customer’s application data.

To predict whether a mortgage will be funded using only this application data, certain leading factors driving the loan’s ultimate status will be identified. Solvers will discover the specific aspects of the dataset that have the greatest impact, and build a model based on this information.
